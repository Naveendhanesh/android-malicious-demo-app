android-malicious-demo-app
==========================

If you read the Blackhat "Adventures in Bouncerland" whitepaper regarding official APPS that spy on Android Smartphones we got some news for you: no - we didn't write another whitepaper. We did a nice smooth app itsself : record phones, sms, track location changes, silently take pictures etc. and watch all the fun beeing uploaded to a webconsole from where you control the smartphone with dynamic updates using WEBVIEW.

This software consists of an application which runs on android devices and "simulates" an anti-theft app to only locate your stolen phoe. But once started the app actually can get controled by a webserver (inlcuded as well here) that allows the malicious admin to activate features like phone recording, sms snooping etc. Used for a security demo and approved by google play or amazon: it does not reveal its malicous nature so quickly.
